Create three classes, Person, Professor, and Student.

Person Class
- data members
    - name
    - age

Professor Class
- int members
    - publications
    - cur_id
- member functions
    - getdata
        - get input from user: name, age, publications
    - putdata
        - print data: name, age, publications, cur_id

Student Class
- data memebers
    - marks, which is an array size 6
    - cur_id
- member functions
    - getdata
        - get input from user: name, age, marks (of 6 subjects)
    - putdata
        - print data: name, age, sum of the marks, cur_id

FOR EACH OBJECT BEING CREATED OF THE PROFESSOR AND STUDENT CLASS, SEQUENTIAL ID'S SHOULD BE ASSIGNED TO THEM STARTING FROM 1.

Solve this problem using virtual functions, constructors and static variables. You can create more data members if you want.
