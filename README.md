# HackerRank

My solutions to various HackerRank challenges. 

Most, if not all, of these challenges are built around specific input/output requirements and constraints. For example, if a variable is guaranteed to never be less than 0, that case will not be considered.

Challenge descriptions, including these contraints, are included in a large comment block at the beginning of each file. This is for quick reference, but the challenges can also easily be looked up on HackerRank.com based on the naming conventions used.

## Organization and Naming Convention

The names of files reflect the full name of the challenge and reside in a folder named after the domain and subdomains (if any) as they appear on HackerRank -- the goal is to make it easy to find the challenge based on the file name or vice versa. 

## Languages ( C++, Java, Python )

As of 7/11/2017, most challenges are in C++ but some are in Java and Python (currently in a separate repository that will be merged with this one). C++ and Java solutions are compiled and run on a Linux system to test (GNU 6.3.0 / Java 8 as of 7/11/2017), and then submitted to HackerRank to be verified as correct solutions before being committed unless otherwise noted in the comment.

Rather than making a new repository to keep languages separate, this one repository will contain all of my solutions. Other than the "Language Track" series of challenges, HackerRank challenges are not specific to any language and often cover more broad topics such as Algorithms, or are part of a competition. I switch between languages depending on what I want to practice that day, what I am most comfortable with (in the case of a competition), or what language I happen to be using most at the time of completion.
