/*
Task

A linked list is said to contain a cycle if any node is visited more than once while traversing the list.

Complete the function provided in the editor below. It has one parameter: a pointer to a Node object named head that points to the head of a linked list. Your function must return a boolean denoting whether or not there is a cycle in the list. If there is a cycle, return true; otherwise, return false.

Input Format

Our hidden code checker passes the appropriate argument to your function. You are not responsible for readying any input from stdin.

Constraints

0 <= List size <= 100

Output Format

If the list contains a cycle, your function must return true. If the list does not contain a cycle, it must return false. The binary integer corresponding to the boolean value returned by your function is printed by stdout by our hidden code checker.
